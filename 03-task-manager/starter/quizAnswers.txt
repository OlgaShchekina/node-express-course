1.Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.
Middleware functions are functions that are executed between the receiving of a request and the sending of a response
in an Express application. Middleware functions are designed to manipulate the request and response objects,
perform certain operations, and pass control to the next middleware function in the chain.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
-Execute any code.
-Make changes to the request and the response objects.
-End the request-response cycle.
-Call the next middleware in the stack.
-Handling errors and exceptions.
-Logging requests and responses.
-and more...

If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to
the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

2.What does CRUD stand for?
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete

3.You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
  How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?
  - To access the information in the .env file, we can use a package called 'dotenv'.
  - Create a .env file in the root directory of your project, and add the environment variable, like SECRET_KEY = hello
  - Use `require('dotenv').config()` in the app file
  - access: const secretKey = process.env.SECRET_KEY;

  How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your github repository?
  - Add .env to the .gitignore file
